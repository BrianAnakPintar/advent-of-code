# Advent of Code

The goal for me is to use this as a chance to learn new things. As such, most of the code is probably disgusting to look at and read.

### 2025
I ended up not finishing this last year; So this time let's properly finish it!
I won't learn a very "new" language, I'm using this to brush up a bit on my Python since
I need to get used to data structures needed for interviews. C++ is bad since my interviewer
can't debug it as easily as Python :(.

### 2024
This year I think using Go would be a great way to brush up and somewhat learn the various built-in libraries contained within Go.
